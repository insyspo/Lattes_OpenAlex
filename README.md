## Abstract
This paper proposes a methodology for disambiguating research entities in databases, with a focus on matching authors, institutions, and publications across various systems. The study examines the OpenAlex and Lattes databases (Brazil’s national researcher registry), aiming to enhance the quality and coverage of both databases. Persistent identifiers, such as DOIs and ORCIDs, are utilized to link entities, while co-authorship and affiliation data assist in the matching process. The Levenshtein distance metric is employed to compare names and titles for accuracy. The proposed method is straightforward to implement in tabular databases, making it an effective solution for research information systems. By improving the linkage of authors and publications, this methodology enhances bibliometric research and data curation on platforms like Lattes and OpenAlex. The results illustrate the potential of integrating local and comprehensive databases to address issues of ambiguous names and incomplete metadata.
